# Step 2: 

# In your Week 3 folder, create a folder called ‘tuple’ for this assignment.
#  Create a tuple.py file
# The tuple.py file should includes list of numbers in it:
# (1,2,3,4,5,6,7); 

# In the tuple.py file, write a program according to following specifications
#       Tuple 1 includes list of information of Robert
# o   (name, surname, birth year, favorite movie and year, profession, birthplace) = Robert 

#       Tuple 2 includes list of numbers in it
#       We call the value for [0] in tuple and for tuple 2 we call the value between 1 and 4
#       Run the code- It gives name Robert for first tuple while for second tuple it gives number (2,3 and 4)


tuple1 = ("Scott","Ashcroft", 1974, "1984 in 1984", "Student", "NM")
tuple2 = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7); 

print(tuple1[0])
print(tuple2[1:4] )
